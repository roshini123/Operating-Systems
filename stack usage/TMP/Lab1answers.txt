Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies and the original scheduling policy in XINU?
Ans. 
LINUX SCHEDULER:
ADVANTAGES:
1) There is no starvation as each process is allocated a quantum to execute based on the goodness value.
2) The average response time is low as each process is scheduled based on goodness which considers the priority and the total ticks left.
3) Each process is allowed to execute to its completion unless suspended and in that case a part of its quantum can be carried to the next epoch.
DISADVANTAGES:
1)	The average turnaround time is high
2)	Blocking may cause system hanging
MULTIQUEUE SCHEDULAR:
ADVANTAGES:
1)	There is no starvation.
2)	As the processes are handled by two queues, the handling of processes is done well.
3)	The real time processes are finished fast.
DISADVANTAGES:
1)	Requires random number generator

Original Algorithm:
DISADVANTAGES:
1)	Starvation can occur
Advantages:
Processes with high priority are scheduled first serving the purpose of the priority.
